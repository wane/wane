# Wane

**Wane** is a framework, compiler and a bundler: all at the same time.
It aims to become the only tool you need to build a front-end application.

See what makes it special after the Hello World introduction below.

**WARNING!** This is still just an early prototype.
Beware of super experimental stuff ahead, including bugs and obvious missing features.
Feel free to play around, ask questions and report bugs in the issues section.

## Hello World

To get started, create an empty folder for your project and do the usual `npm init` ceremony.
Then install `wane`, create a new folder `src` and within it a file `entry.ts`.

```
$ npm i @wane/core
$ mkdir src
$ touch src/entry.ts
```

Open the `src/entry.ts` file and write the following.

```typescript
import { Entry, Template } from '@wane/core'

@Entry()
@Template(`Hello, {{ someone }}!`)
export class App {
  someone = 'World'
}
```

Save the file and run the wane compiler.
You can do this quickly by utilizing `npx`.

```
$ npx wane
```

If everything went fine, you should see the success message in green:

```
âœ” Compiled successfully.
```

The built app is contained within the newly created `dist` folder.
Open the `dist/index.html` file from your browser to see the app in action.

The generated JavaScript file is only **580 bytes**.
Yes, that's 0.58kB. 
If you run that through gzip, you get **334 bytes**.
With brotli, you're down to only **273 bytes**.
Here's it again: 

```text
 580 index.js
 334 index.js.gz
 273 index.js.br
``` 

And it can only get better.

Below is a short overview of how it's achieved.

## How's it different

The thing is, there's no _framework_ in the traditional sense.
It just feels like one because it lets you write TypeScript, which you should be already comfortable with.
Add in some decorators and magic happens!

However, behind the scenes, the code you write is treated as a string.
With help of the TypeScript compiler (and the awesome wrapper [`ts-simple-ast`](https://github.com/dsherret/ts-simple-ast)), it statically analyzes your code and completely code-generates everything.

This means that there is **no framework code** at all. 
All code that makes it to the final bundle is **written just for your app**.

In theory, this means that there is nothing stopping Wane from generating the best possible code without any overhead and without any unnecessary code:

- You have an output (an event) on a component that no component listens to? Let's remove it then.
- There is no method that can update the string that you've used for interpolation (`someone` in the Hello World example above)? Then there will be no code generating for updating it: it will be the same as if you've written the value (`"World"`) right there in the template.
- Your component can never be destroyed because it's not inside a `w:if` directive? Then it won't generate the `destroy` method for it.
- Say when you fire an event, you change a variable. A variable that is not bound to the view. So let's not even run the change detection algorithm or re-render anything. Let's only update your model. 

And the best thing is, improvements like these are happening in the compiler.
When a new feature is implemented, you could just run the compiler again over the same code and you could get a smaller bundle and a faster application.

## How to explore

Until I (or someone else) gets around to writing examples and tutorials, your best shot at seeing what is currently implemented are apps created for end-to-end tests under `tests/e2e/apps`.
